Now, we can check each variable for ‘missingness’ by using a counting function to show how many entries are ‘NA’, ‘NULL’, or ‘NaN’ in each column.\n\nsum_na &lt;- function(column){\n  sum(is.na(column) + is.null(column) + is.nan(column))\n}\nna_counts &lt;- diabetes_convert |&gt;\n  summarize(across(everything(), sum_na))\nna_counts\n\n  Diabetes_binary HighBP HighChol CholCheck BMI Smoker Stroke\n1               0      0        0         0   0      0      0\n  HeartDiseaseorAttack PhysActivity Fruits Veggies HvyAlcoholConsump\n1                    0            0      0       0                 0\n  AnyHealthcare NoDocbcCost GenHlth MentHlth PhysHlth DiffWalk Sex Age\n1             0           0       0        0        0        0   0   0\n  Education Income\n1         0      0\n\n\nLooks like we are in luck… No missing entries in any columns. Phew.\n\n\nSummarizations\nNow that we have the data cleaned and ready, we can explore summaries and graphs about the entire data set, which we’ve named diabetes_convert.\nI began by summarizing our response variable of interest: Diabetes_binary, which indicates the diabetic status of the population, across the only numeric variable: BMI.\n\ndiabetes_convert |&gt;\n  group_by(Diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  summarize(across(BMI, .fns = list(\"mean\" = mean, \n                                       \"median\" = median, \n                                       \"var\" = var, \n                                       \"sd\" = sd, \n                                       \"IQR\" = IQR), .names = \"{.fn}_{.col}\"))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  Diabetes_binary mean_BMI median_BMI var_BMI sd_BMI IQR_BMI\n  &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No Diabetes         27.8         27    39.6   6.29       7\n2 Prediabetes         31.9         31    54.2   7.36       8\n\n\nExcellent, now we can see the differences in the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range of the BMIs for both patients with no diabetic status and prediabetic status.\nPatients with prediabetic status have a 4 point average and median difference of BMI from patients with no diabetes. The variance and standard deviations are also wider for prediabetic patients than those without diabetes.\nLet’s check out the contingency table of sex versus diabetic status.\n\ndiabetes_convert |&gt;\n  group_by(Sex, Diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  summarize(count=n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = count/sum(count)) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Sex'. You can override using the `.groups`\nargument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n# Groups:   Sex [2]\n  Sex    Diabetes_binary  count Proportion\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Female No Diabetes     123563      0.870\n2 Female Prediabetes      18411      0.130\n3 Male   No Diabetes      94771      0.848\n4 Male   Prediabetes      16935      0.152\n\n\nPerfect! We can see that for females, the proportion of patients with prediabetes versus no diabetes is around 13%, while 15% of the male patients are prediabetic. I wonder what else we can find…\n\ndiabetes_convert |&gt;\n  group_by(Age, Diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  summarize(count=n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = count/sum(count)) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Age'.
